Starting a [jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) post is one of the minor annoyances of using jekyll (otherwise there are few).  However, you can certainly script the redundant task. And, there are several scripts out there, but few worked well for me without throwing an error or two.  So, I forked one script, added pieces of another, and the outcome is below:

<script src="http://gist.github.com/608362.js"> </script>
