So, there's tools out there to get your documentation up on github ([github-tools][1], [sphinx-to-github][2]), but neither totally jive with how I want to do things.  So, I went searching long and hard for a way to:

* keep the document-generating source in `master`
* place the generated html in `gh-pages`, so it's served as static html
* have everything just "work"
