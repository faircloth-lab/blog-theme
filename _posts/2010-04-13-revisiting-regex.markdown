To follow up on a [previous post](http://ambiguousbase.tumblr.com/post/444839066/of-parsers-regex-and-python), Google has today released [re2][1], noting the release in a [blog post](http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2010/03/re2-principled-approach-to-regular.html).  From the [re2][1] website:

>RE2 is a fast, safe, thread-friendly alternative to backtracking 
>regular expression engines like those used in PCRE, Perl, and 
>Python. It is a C++ library.
