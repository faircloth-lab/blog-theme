I recently came across a situation in which I needed to assemble some reads from a critter that we gathered from a couple of [454][1] sequencing runs.  Unfortunately, the assembly of these runs using [gsAssembler 2.5.3][2] required a bit more RAM than available on our local workstation running a Fedora image in VMware.

So, I decided to assemble the reads using [Amazon EC2][3].  The process was relatively painless once I found an OS image that would boot properly with the instance type I chose (m2.2xlarge.  see [here][4] for a list).  

Here's the steps to follow using a 64-bit Amazon Linux image:
