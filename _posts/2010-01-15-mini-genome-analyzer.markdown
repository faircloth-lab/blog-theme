[![mini illumina genome analyzer][6]][7]

Not to be outdone by [Roche][1], [Illumina][2] has announced a new version of it's Genome Analyzer:  the [IIe][3].  The IIe's specs are generally pretty reasonable (18-20 GB in about 10 days @ 2x100).  Cost will be approximately $250,000. 

Ilumina also annouced a big brother to the [IIx][4], the [HiSeq2000][5], which kicks things up a notch to 150-200 Gb (of 2x100) in about 8 days.

Wow.
