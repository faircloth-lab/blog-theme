We have a [nanodrop](http://nanodrop.com/) in our lab.  It serves us extremely well, and i really appreciate it - i was initially "broken in" on an older spectrophotometer (Beckman DU-800) that basically required you to sacrifice half your sample to get a so-so measure of DNA concentration.

Because we have a nanodrop in our lab, people often ask me about [260/280](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acids_analysis) ratios.  Well, more commonly, they ask me about 260/280 ratios when things go [poorly](http://media.photobucket.com/image/nuclear%20bomb/glamgalz/funzug/imgs/misc/nuclear_bomb_expo_01.jpg).

First, i should state that the **gold standard** for whether or not a DNA extraction is "good" (i,e. assuming you are doing PCR) is whether or not you can get it to amplify... with or without [trickeration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelex_100).

Second, for those still interested in 260/280 ratios and the presence of contaminants, i offer this handy little publication (from nanodrop/thermofisher), which i'll just refer to as [number nine](http://www.nanodrop.com/Library/T009-NanoDrop%201000-&-NanoDrop%208000-Nucleic-Acid-Purity-Ratios.pdf).
