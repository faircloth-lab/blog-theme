Just ran across this - [Pianobar][1] - which is a CLI for [Pandora][2].  This builds pretty easily on the mac.  Following (with a modification) instructions from [this][3] thread over at [reddit.com][4]:

<del>Install [MacPorts][5] or make sure it's squared away with this [gist](http://gist.github.com/331169)</del>

**Update:  it's fantastic!**

**Update 2:  just install it using [homebrew](6):**

    brew install pianobar
